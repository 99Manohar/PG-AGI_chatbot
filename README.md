# ü§ñ PG-AGI ‚Äì AI-Powered Hiring Assistant

Welcome to **PG-AGI**, a Streamlit-based AI chatbot built for "TalentScout," a fictional recruitment agency focused on tech placements. PG-AGI acts as an intelligent Hiring Assistant, screening candidates by gathering essential details and generating relevant technical questions based on the declared tech stack.

PG-AGI uses **Google's gemini-1.5-flash-latest model** with Langchain, offering:

* Smart candidate interaction
* Sentiment analysis
* Language translation support
* Context-aware chat history
* Automatic chat log saving

This tool demonstrates effective **prompt engineering**, **LLM integration**, and **interactive UI development** with **Streamlit**.

## üöÄ Running the App

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

---

## üß† Prompt Design Strategy

The system prompt defines the assistant's role and task breakdown. It ensures structured information gathering followed by stack-aware technical questioning.

**System Prompt Example:**

```
You are TalentScout, a professional hiring assistant for a tech recruitment agency...
```

Prompts are dynamically generated based on user input and appended to a `ChatPromptTemplate` using Langchain.

---

## üí¨ Example Interaction Flow

1. Chatbot greets the user.
2. Collects profile details (name, experience, tech stack, etc).
3. Generates tailored questions (e.g., Python, React, etc).
4. Applies sentiment analysis on each input.
5. Translates input if not in English.
6. Ends the chat gracefully when the user types "exit".
7. Saves chat log.
